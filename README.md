Make sure that the Read More of the top most div is an anchor tag which leads to this wikipedia link - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle
Then make the image section - in which you can also change the image but the image src should be of the breed beagle.
The third section is the trivia - make sure this is an ordered list.
Also make sure the ui is the same, ie the places where the word is bold should be bold, the places where italics is used use italics and so on.
